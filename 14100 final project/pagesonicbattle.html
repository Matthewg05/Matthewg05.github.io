												<p>Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends as they discover Emerl, a powerful robot with the ability to copy combat skills. Emerl is found by Sonic and Tails and initially has no memory of his past. As Emerl learns and grows, he becomes a valuable ally to Sonic and his friends. However, as Emerl's power increases, he becomes a target for the nefarious Dr. Eggman, who seeks to use him for his own evil purposes. Alongside Eggman, other adversaries such as Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat also attempt to manipulate Emerl for their own ends.
